Part 2 of Large number multiplication.
describe any red, yellow, or green level issues with your code. 
For red and yellow issues, discuss what led to them;

Yellow:
When it came to initializing the code I thought we were unable to use If statements due to the first assignment. 
Red: 
I believe my code was not specific enough for which numbers were meant to be used. It was very broad. 

suggest how the code could be improved;
 - A way my code could be improved would be to curate more time and focus on it. I didn't plan the code other priorly and it was definitely noticeable when it came to figuring 
out a code for the days of the week. 
reflect if the quality of your code is related to time management and how to mitigate things.
- The quality of my code was related to time management. I was working on it for some time and could not figure out how to initialize a
method for the days of the week. 
- I was struggling for a few hours and due to not having more spare time during the day I was unable to figure out
what else to add to my code.
